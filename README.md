# CityAPIBench
A Large-scale Graph Dataset of Domain-Adapted Large Language Models from Open Government Data in AI Era.

The work was preliminarily presented in 2025 CUPUM.

The database is still under construction. Please stay tuned and star me!

The database will include the API schema and metadata of over 20,000 APIs from global cities, as well as the following six types of relationships between datasets to help you, whether you are human or a robot, navigate through them.
